NewRamCentral — Manual Test Plan

Run through this checklist before every Sprint 2 demo and before final submission. Log any failures as GitHub Issues using the bug report template.

Authentication
Sign up with a new email/RAM ID/password succeeds and lands on the Clubs home page.
Signing up with an email already in use shows a clear error, not a crash.
Logging out returns to the Login page and blocks access to /, /clubs/:id, /events, /profile, and /create-club until logging back in.
Refreshing the page while logged in keeps the session (does not bounce to Login).
Clubs
Newly created club appears immediately under "My clubs" for its creator.
Search filters the club list live by name and category.
Joining a club with requiresApproval: false immediately increments member count.
Joining a club with requiresApproval: true creates a pending request, not an approved membership.
An officer can see and approve pending requests; approving increments member count.
Leaving a club decrements member count only if the membership was approved.
Officer tools
Only officers/president see "Edit club info," "Post announcement," "Create event," and "Promote to officer" controls; plain members do not.
Promoting a member to officer is reflected immediately in their badge and unlocks officer controls for them on next load.
Posting an announcement appears at the top of the list in real time (no refresh needed).
Events
Creating an event with a past date is still accepted (documented limitation) but appears correctly sorted.
The Events page only shows events from clubs the signed-in user has joined.
RSVP button is only visible to approved members of that event's club.
Security rules (verify in the Firebase console, not just the UI)
A non-officer cannot write to a club's announcements subcollection directly (test via Firestore Rules Playground or Emulator, not just by hiding the button in the UI).
A signed-out request to any protected collection is rejected.
Cross-browser / responsive
Test in Chrome and at least one other browser.
Test at a narrow (mobile-width) viewport — navigation and forms should remain usable.
